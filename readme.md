# Blackout: Dark Mode Widget for WordPress
üåì Add a Dark Mode / Night Mode to your website in a few seconds

A simple solution to allow your users to enable/disable dark mode on your website.

It creates a widget that your users can use to toggle between normal and dark modes.

It uses the CSS mix-blend-mode to bring dark-mode to any of your websites.

Sandoche made the widget and, it has a standalone version that allows you to implement it on your website by copy+pasting a simple JavaScript script, you can find more about that by [clicking here](https://darkmodejs.learn.uno/).

## üìñ How to use
As with any other WordPress plugin, you can follow this simple steps to install it:

* Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer, or extract the zip file and drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.
* Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress.
* Go to settings > Blackout to customize the configurations of the widget (optional).

## Override style
* Use the class `darkmode-ignore` where you don't want to apply darkmode, it will implement `mix-blend-mode: difference;` but only when the widget is active, that way it won't look weird if it's disabled.

**You don't need to do it with images or iframes as it's added by default.**

## Browser compatibility
This library uses the CSS `mix-blend-mode: difference;` in order to provide the Dark Mode.
It may not be compatible with all the browsers.
