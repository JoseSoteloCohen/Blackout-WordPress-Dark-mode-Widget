# Blackout: Dark Mode Widget for WordPress
üåì Add a Dark Mode / Night Mode to your website in a few seconds

A simple solution to allow your users to enable/disable dark mode on your website.

It creates a widget that your users can use to toggle between normal and dark modes.

It uses the CSS mix-blend-mode to bring dark-mode to any of your websites.

Sandoche made the widget and, it has a standalone version that allows you to implement it on your website by copy+pasting a simple JavaScript script, you can find more about that by [clicking here](https://darkmodejs.learn.uno/).
